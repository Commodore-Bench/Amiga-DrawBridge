# Amiga DrawBridge
Rob Smith made an excellent solution for reading Amiga floppy disks on a modern systems, describing it as the **Arduino Amiga Floppy Disk Reader/Writer aka DrawBridge**. He also made what appears to be excellent PCBs for building these directly into USB floppy drives, but I wanted to draw something less impressive - so I made this.
