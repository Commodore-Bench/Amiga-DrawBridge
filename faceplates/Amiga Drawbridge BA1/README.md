# Amiga Drawbridge BA1
A backplate designed to be installed on the underside of the main [Amiga DrawBridge](https://github.com/tebl/Amiga-DrawBridge/tree/main/Amiga%20Drawbridge)-module, the purpose for installing it was simply to have something that could sit on the bottom on the module so that none of the electronics could short against the disk drive being used. You could always just use standoffs, but this was a cheap solution while keeping with the aesthetic of the build.
