# Amiga Drawbridge FA2
A faceplate designed to be installed onto the main [Amiga DrawBridge](https://github.com/tebl/Amiga-DrawBridge/tree/main/Amiga%20Drawbridge)-module, it has cutouts for the 34-pin IDC socket as well as the LEDs found on the module. Note that as the faceplate will sit a bit higher up on the standoffs, the LEDs will need to be soldered around a millimeter above the board - the recommended way of installing them is to insert them into the footprint (longer pin in the round hole), install the faceplate and then solder the LEDs into place with the LED flush against the faceplate.
